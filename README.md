Learning x86 assembly by following PFTGU ([Programming from the Ground Up] (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pgubook/)) by Jonathan Bartlett.
This book is not really designed around a central project or goal outside learning programming beginning with assembly so I will be using this repo as a place to follow along with the examples as well as test out small scale assembly programs to learn more.
The main motive behind learning x86 assembly was the realization that I did not know enough to get that far into [Let's build a Compiler] (http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/), a series I am following [here] (https://github.com/coddinkn/lets_build_a_compiler).
